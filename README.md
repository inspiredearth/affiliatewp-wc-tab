Credit goes to [Eric and his blog post](https://eric.blog/2016/12/22/adding-affiliate-wp-dashboard-to-woocommerce-my-account-page/), and to Benny who commented on Eric's blog post on October 28, 2020 at 3:20 am, providing the code I've supplied here on this Git.

## Purpose
AffiliateWP is a great affiliate system for Wordpress / WooCommerce. It's integration into WooCommerce is lacking when it comes to the Affiliate Dashboard. The user has to go to a separate dashboard from the WooCommerce "My Account" dashboard.

This code will resolve that.


## Instructions

Simply add the provided code into the `functions.php` file of your child theme.

Note, you will need to use the slug `aff-area` for your AffiliateWP dashboard page.
